Simple Pizza Order Management (WinForms)

This is a simple Windows Forms application I created when I first started learning **WinForms**.  
It was my first hands-on project to understand how desktop applications work using C# and the .NET Framework.

### Project Overview
The application simulates a basic pizza ordering system with a user interface that allows:
- Selecting pizza type and size
- Choosing toppings
- Calculating total price

**Note:**  
This project does **not** use any database or advanced design patterns â€” it was created purely for learning purposes and to get familiar with the WinForms environment.

### Purpose
This project represents the very **beginning of my journey** into software development and UI design using C#.  
Since then, I've worked on more advanced and structured projects that reflect my current level and growth.
